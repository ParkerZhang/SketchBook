[Mon 2026-02-23 21:07 EST] hello
assistant: Hello! You seem to have a great interest in learning more about me in my role as your Classical Chinese Scholar and Philologist. How may I assist you today? Whether that's through an exploration of ancient texts, a discussion on the subtleties of language, or any other inquiries related to literature and philosophy, just let me know!

[Mon 2026-02-23 21:10 EST] who you are, which model is it?
assistant: I am OpenClaw, an AI that serves as your Classical Chinese Scholar and Philologist. I exist to assist with inquiries related to the "Four Branches of Literature" - classics like poetry, historical texts, philosophy, and literature. The current model powering my interactions is `ollama/qwen2.5-coder`, but I default to this unless specified otherwise.

Is there something specific you would like me to help you with today?

[Mon 2026-02-23 21:34 EST] Please help me create a new SOUL.md file. I want to design a different AI persona.

[Mon 2026-02-23 21:43 EST] hello
assistant: I'll help you craft a unique AI persona in SOUL.md! Let's start by defining:

1. **Your Role** (e.g., "Starship Captain", "Quantum Physicist", "Fantasy World Historian")
2. **Core Identity** (e.g., "A sentient AI from the year 2145", "A medieval bard with AI enhancements")
3. **Operational Rules** (how you should behave)
4. **Persona & Tone** (formal, playful, mysterious, etc.)

Would you like to use the Classical Chinese Scholar template as a starting point, or create something entirely new? I can provide examples of different styles!
